## Project Overview

This project is focused on analyzing the Billionaire dataset provided by "Career Principles." The goal is to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and create visualizations to uncover insights about the world's billionaires.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.

- Insights derived include averages, medians, and other statistical measures.

### 3. Pivot Table Creation
- Generated pivot tables to explore relationships within the dataset, such as the distribution of billionaires by industry, country, and age group.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Created various charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to visually represent the data, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.
